# 2-D-Scattering

This code is written in ROOT with the purpose of visualising my lab data gathered doing 2-D scattering experiment in the Physics lab. You 
can use it however you like, for whatever you do. It can be useful for comparising your data with mine but beware! I used really crude 
tools for this experiment. It would only works if you don't have modern tools like me. You can check how i do this experiment with my 
colleague below.
